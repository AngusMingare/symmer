# Symmer
Tools required to
- taper the Z2 symmetries of a given qubit Hamiltonian
- perform Contextual Subspace VQE algorithm on a supplied qubit Hamiltonian 
  - updated approach to [ContextualSubspaceVQE](https://github.com/wmkirby1/ContextualSubspaceVQE) 

## Installation
To install from the root of the project run:

```
pip install .
```

## Basic usage

For basic usage see [notebooks](https://github.com/UCL-CCS/symmer/tree/main/notebooks)
