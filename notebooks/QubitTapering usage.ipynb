    "# Qubit Tapering \n",
    "### in the Stabilizer Subspace Projection formalism\n",
    "Here, we take a look at the qubit reduction technique of [tapering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08213) and an implementation based on the core `S3_projection` class. Unlike [Contextual-Subspace VQE](https://doi.org/10.22331/q-2021-05-14-456), this technique is *exact*, in the sense that it perfectly preserves the energy spectrum of the input operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of qubit tapering is a symmetry of the Hamiltonian, which in this case means a set of universally commuting operators. The idea is that these operators must be simultaneously measureable and so can be treated independently of the remaining Hamiltonian terms. The method works by finding an independent generating set for the symmetry and seeks to find the 'correct' assignment of eigenvalues (called a *sector*), which completely determines the measurement outcome of the symmetry operators. Once this is obtained, the theory of stabilizers allows us to rotate the symmetry generators onto single Pauli $X$ operators, and since they must commute universally every operator of the rotated Hamiltonian will consist of an identity or Pauli $X$ in the corresponding qubit position. This means we can drop the qubit from the Hamiltonian, leaving in its place the eigenvalue determined by the chosen sector."

    "We are now in a position to initialize our `QubitTapering` class, which will identify a set of independent operators $\\mathcal{S}$ that generate the Hamiltonian symmetry. Since the set is independent, there will exist a Clifford rotation $U$ mapping the elements $S \\in \\mathcal{S}$ to single-qubit Pauli operators, i.e. $USU^* = \\sigma_p^{(i)}$ for some qubit position $i$ and $p \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ corresponding with Pauli $\\{X,Y,Z\\}$ operators; this observation that each Hamiltonian symmetry contributes a qubits-worth degree of freedom is at the core of Qubit Tapering. Since $S$ commutes with each term of $H$ by definition, the single-qubit Pauli $\\sigma_p^{(i)}$ must commute with the rotated Hamiltonian $UHU^*$, meaning each term therein must consist either of identity or $\\sigma_p$ in the qubit position indexed by $i$. As such, the qubit may be dropped from the Hamiltonian, leaving in its place a $\\pm1$ eigenvalue. In our implementation, the above Clifford rotation is constructed as a sequence of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ rotations $U_k = e^{i \\frac{\\pi}{4} R_k}$, yielding $U = \\prod_{k=1}^{|\\mathcal{S}|} U_k$.
